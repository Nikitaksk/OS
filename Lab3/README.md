# 3d Practice Task (OS)

The program is a multi-threaded C++ application that simulates marker threads working on an array. The user provides the size of the array and the number of marker threads. Each marker thread randomly selects an index in the array and marks it with its thread number. If the selected index is already marked, the marker thread continues searching for an unmarked index.
